# Traffic-Light-System
Arduino based  traffic light simulation built  on ThinkerCad .
# Features
Automatic switching between Red, Yellow and Green LEDs with a delay of 10 seconds.
Demonstrated basic Arduino automation concepts.
Used delay() fuunction for Real-time processing.
Buzzer buzzes after each LED.
# Components
* Arduino UNO R3
* Three resistors of 220 ohm
* Three LEDs RED,YELLOW,GREEN
* Piezo Buzzer
# Working
The circuit contains Arduino UNO R3 , Breadboard, resistors 220 ohm, LEDS RED,YELLOW and GREEN. The resistors are connected in series with the LEDs and each resistor's end is connected to Arduino pins and the other end connected to LEDS anode and the cathode is connected to the Ground pin in Arduino. The positive end of Piezo buzzer is attached to Arduino pin and the negative end is connected to ground pin of Arduino. When circuit is switched on the RED LED is swtiched on for 10 secs and after that the buzzer buzzes and next LED is switched on and the process repeats.
